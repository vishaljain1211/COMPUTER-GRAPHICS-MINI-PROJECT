To make the movement of the gun, the used different keyboard functions and display to make the program user interactive.

The rectangle shape of bricks created outside the window the bricks move down. If we use only keyboard function then the only bullet will fire. If gunfire the bullet exact center of the bricks then collision of the bricks takes place. After the collision of bricks, the score will be increased.

When red and yellow bricks are collided by bullet same bricks will come by a distance of +50 in the x-axis. If blue and green bricks are collided by bullet same bricks will come by a distance of -50 in the x-axis. When the bricks reach the window game over is displayed with the current score.
